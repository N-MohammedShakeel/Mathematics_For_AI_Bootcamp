        "Picture yourself setting up a classroom for a big lesson. You line up desks in neat rows and columns, placing a card with each student’s name, grade, and favorite subject on top. That’s what rectangular data is—a tidy, grid-like structure where info slots perfectly into rows and columns, like a recipe book with ingredients listed step-by-step. It’s the go-to format for turning raw data into something we can explore, analyze, and even teach a computer to get!"
