        "# 1.6 Estimates of Variability\n",
        "Picture a playground where some kids are bunched up near the swings, while others are scattered toward the slides. Or think of tracking daily temperatures—some days are steady, others swing wildly. That’s what estimates of variability are about—measuring how spread out or consistent your data is using tools like range, standard deviation, and percentiles. It’s like figuring out if your toy collection is all similar or full of surprises!"
