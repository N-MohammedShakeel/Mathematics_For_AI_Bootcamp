# Linear Algebra Topics for AI/ML

This document outlines the key Linear Algebra topics required for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), with definitions, their relevance in mathematics and ML, and practical applications.

## 1. Vectors
### Definition
Vectors are one-dimensional arrays representing quantities with magnitude and direction in a vector space. In ML, they are typically numerical arrays (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) used to represent data points, features, or weights.

### Subtopics and Operations
- **Vector Representation**: A vector is an ordered list of numbers in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) (e.g., \( \mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n] \)).
- **Addition**: Adding two vectors of the same dimension element-wise (e.g., \( \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = [u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, \dots] \)).
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a vector by a scalar (e.g., \( c\mathbf{v} = [cv_1, cv_2, \dots] \)).
- **Dot Product**: A scalar computed as \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \dots + u_nv_n \).
- **Cross Product**: A vector perpendicular to two 3D vectors, defined as \( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = [u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1] \).

### Relevance in Mathematics
Vectors are fundamental in linear algebra, representing points in multidimensional space. They form the basis for understanding higher-dimensional objects like matrices and tensors. Operations like addition and dot products define geometric properties (e.g., angles, lengths) and enable transformations in vector spaces.

### Relevance in ML
Vectors are the primary data structure in ML:
- **Data Representation**: Features (e.g., pixel values in an image, word embeddings) are stored as vectors.
- **Model Parameters**: Weights in neural networks are vectors.
- **Operations**: Vector operations enable computations like similarity measures and transformations.

### Applications and Practical Use-Cases
- **Vector Addition**:
  - **Why Necessary**: Combines multiple feature vectors or updates model parameters. For example, in gradient descent, the parameter update rule \( \mathbf{w} \leftarrow \mathbf{w} - \eta \nabla L \) involves adding the negative gradient (a vector) to the weight vector.
  - **ML Use-Case**: In linear regression, combining feature vectors to compute predictions (e.g., \( \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b \)). In neural networks, summing weighted inputs in a neuron.
- **Scalar Multiplication**:
  - **Why Necessary**: Scales vectors to adjust magnitudes, used in optimization (e.g., scaling gradients) or normalization.
  - **ML Use-Case**: Normalizing feature vectors to unit length for algorithms like SVM or k-means clustering to ensure fair comparisons.
- **Dot Product**:
  - **Why Necessary**: Measures similarity (cosine of the angle) between vectors or projects one vector onto another. It’s computationally efficient for high-dimensional data.
  - **ML Use-Case**: In neural networks, the dot product computes the weighted sum of inputs (\( \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} \)). In NLP, it measures similarity between word embeddings (e.g., cosine similarity).
- **Cross Product**:
  - **Why Necessary**: Used in 3D spaces to find perpendicular vectors, less common in ML but relevant in specific applications.
  - **ML Use-Case**: In computer vision or robotics, cross products compute normal vectors for planes (e.g., in 3D reconstruction or camera orientation).

## 2. Matrices
### Definition
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns (e.g., \( \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} \)), representing linear transformations or data collections.

### Subtopics and Operations
- **Matrix Representation**: An \( m \times n \) matrix has \( m \) rows and \( n \) columns.
